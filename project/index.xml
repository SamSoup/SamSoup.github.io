      <description>Introduction and MotivationAnyone who has worked in the industry has been in the following scenario: you work hard to be promoted for X position, while in the end some competitor Y gets promoted to the position instead. You feel annoyed; you feel that it’s unfair! Y is clearly way less suitable than you are for this position! Y must have cheated or hitched a deal with the boss!</description>

      <description>IntroductionI have always loved reading, so I thought may not use R and data science to help me decided which book I should read next! After poking around on Kaggle, I have found two datasets containing a myraid of information on many titles. The first dataset by Soumik originated from him scraping the GoodReads API using ISBNs and contains the variables ‘bookID’ (a unique integer associated with each book), ‘title’, ‘authors’, ‘average rating’ (0-5 scale), ‘isbn’, ‘isbn13’, ‘langauge code’ (eng or other languages), ‘num_pages’, ‘ratings_count’ (total number of ratings), ‘text_reviews_count’ (total number of written text reviews).</description>
